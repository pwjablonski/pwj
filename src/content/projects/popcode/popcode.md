[Popcode](https://popcode.org) is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript editing
environment for use in the classroom created by Mat Brown. It's a lot like [JSBin](http://jsbin.com),
[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), or [CodePen](https://codepen.io), but it focuses on
giving specific, immediate, human-friendly feedback when the code contains errors.

I've learned a lot about React and Firebase through contibuting to this project!
